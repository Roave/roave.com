    <p>Weâ€™ll look at how we implemented event sourcing in our own app, code-reviews.io:</p>

    <p>Zend Server for IBM i has done a great job at allowing enterprise PHP applications to run smoothly on the IBM i platform. But what about developing for the platform? Having recently been hired for a PHP project on IBM i, we wanted to ensure the project was using the best practices possible. This involved embarking on a whole new collaborative journey - uniting expert platform knowledge with bleeding-edge modern PHP development practices. We'll show you the process our team went through on the project to revolutionize the client's development process by introducing database abstraction, unit tests, functional tests, continuous integration, automated deployment, and more.</p>
