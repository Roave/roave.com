            <img src="https://joind.in/img/avg-rating-5.png">

            <p>Event Sourcing can look like an attractive solution for any of your applications, but does it actually pay off?</p>

            <p>What if it is all just buzzwords and no gain?</p>

            <p>Weâ€™ll look at how we implemented event sourcing in our own app, code-reviews.io:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>what made us fast</li>
                <li>What made us super slow</li>
                <li>What made us cry</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This talk will give you a good idea of what kind of challenges you will encounter when approaching event sourcing for the first time.</p>
