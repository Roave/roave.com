  <p>It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.

      <p>If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Soothe us with sweet lies. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!</p>

  <h4>School Reunion</h4>
  <p>I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? You've swallowed a planet! The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.&hellip;hey.&hellip;the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.</p>

    <li>You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?</li>
    <li>I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.</li>
    <li>Did I mention we have comfy chairs?</li>
    <li>I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!</li>
  </ol>

  <h5>The Doctor's Wife</h5>
  <p>I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. Saving the world with meals on wheels. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! You hit me with a cricket bat. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.</p>

  <h2>The Big Bang</h2>
  <p>I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. Saving the world with meals on wheels. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? Did I mention we have comfy chairs? All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?</li>
    <li>Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.</li>

  <h3>Daleks in Manhattan</h3>
  <p>Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. No&hellip; It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!</p>
